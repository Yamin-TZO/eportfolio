              In 2018, 100 university people have been trained intensively with facilitators in order to be job accelerated people in a year. 
              Those people are chosen with many factors and only a high spirited talent can be selected. Above all, only 100 students can been accepted and trained per year.

            <p>
              We wanted to build an affordable and accessible learning system that can enhanced youths to be able to
              grasp the maximum opportunities they can access with effective design, while keeping in mind of inclusivity.
              We had proven this process by training over 100 people intensively both online and offline. 
              The question was, how can we give that same process to the entire youth population of Myanmar.

          <div class="p-2">
            <h3 class="highlight">The Solution</h3>
            <p>
              We want to build an affordable accessible best-in-class LMS which offers bite-sized microlearning and
              opportunities with a 5% churn rate of educational subscription service that embraced a rapidly evolving
              21st century skills with the mission to equip all of Myanmar's graduates with the skills to become
              valuable members of the workforce and community.

              We started it with the first stage of design thinking process “empathize” and approach the problems with
              human-centered and design thinking methods iteratively throughout the process. It includes UX deliveries such as 
              <b>
                persona mapping, user journey, focus group usability testing, ethnographic interview, monthly
                quantitative and qualitative analysis on users’ demographic and behavioral data. I use other methods of ideation
                tools such as crazy 8s, dot voting and etc.

              With pre-existing assumption that youths in Myanmar need to learn digital literacy and soft skills of 21st
              century skills in order to achieve whatever the opportunity is. In order to approve or disapprove that
              hypothesis and understand users’ needs, wants, feeling, pain-points and motivation, I started with persona mapping
              with 8 youths among targeted groups of youths.
            </p>
            <p>
              I chose the participants very carefully for the sake of the fact that overlapping the same types of persona
              and being left out of the persona. So, I basically chose the current users’ status on demographic, attending

              Through persona mapping and industry-research of similar information sharing pages, five main-insights caught my thoughts

              In terms of statistical research, 4.3 millions Myanmar youths aged  between 18 to 24 years use Messenger in 2019. 
              So, the strategic manager decided to make learning management system with messenger-based automated chatbot.
              So, I was needed to do research about writing conversion for instant message-based platform and teaching through text-based platform. 
              I did research for a week on similar message-based applications such as wysa, dualingo and woebot. In the meantime, I also need to observe other LMS how information artictecture works such as coursea, udemy and edX.
              I conclude the onboarding message with 3 key factors as below:
              <ol>
                <li>What the product is and its price?</li>
                <li>Course Syllabus and how a user will be taught?</li>
                <li>The benefits of the course?</li>

            After spending two weeks on my research and two weeks of implementation by two developers, 
            we could finish a minimum viable product with messenger chatbot which includes:
            <ul>
              <li>Opportunities session where categorize all opportunities and one week latest opportunities</li>
              <li>Scholarship Preparation Courses</li>
              <li>Digital Skills and Soft Skills Courses</li>
              <li>Skills Tests which a user can reflect what he/she/they learnt by taking some questionaries that can earn 10 points for every right answer</li>
              <li>Fun Quizzes which a user can take engaging general knowledge questionaries</li>
              <li>Market Place where exclusive opportunities, training and coaching can be either redeemed with points or bought with affordable price</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Within one week after finishing, I could lead rapid usability test with 5people of 4 focus groups with my development team. 
            The goals were:
            <ol>
              <li>To understand the pain points of conversation</li>
              <li>To approve/disapprove the assumption that messenger-based chatbot learning is more user friendly than application usage in Myanmar</li>

            There are three primary questions out of many minor considerations in order to form the final version of the product. Those primary were:
            <ul>
              <li>What and why do they love and hate about product?</li>
              <li>What can enhance conversion to 30%?</li>
              <li>What can decrease churn to 5%?</li>

          <p>
            It was important to understand what they love to use and why they influence users’ behaviour. 
            I worked with a development team to map out the users who were considered to be our lovers to the product. 
            Then, we conducted a qualitative interview with 19 lovers.
          </p>
          <h3 class="text-center">3 Main Findings were:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Opportunities make conversion:</strong> 53% of interviewees buy the product by only
              knowing about one categories called opportunities among five categories [opportunities, courses,
              skills tests, fun quizzes, market place]. After using a couple of weeks, they are getting to know
              other values about the product beyond opportunities such as free courses, skill tests and fun
              quizzes.</li>
            <li><strong>All features has value:</strong> Each and every features has the value for users.
              Opportunities and Courses are equally the most popular value to the users out of all things.
              Users’ success has been happened when they got reflection by themselves after learning while
              accessing relevant and most updated opportunities on a click.</li>
            <li><strong>he interface exacerbate to understand product value:</strong> The interface were a bit
              confusing in order to know the difference between skills tests and fun quizzes. There is no such
              valuable proposition in market place interface too. Users are being lost of product value among
              multiple choices.</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="mb-5"></div>
          <h3 class="text-center">Where I was stuck by:</h3>
          <h4 class="text-center">“Even though courses are as same value as opportunities, why can’t it make conversion?”</h4>
          
          <div class="mb-5"></div>
          <h3 class="text-center">Walking backward from perfect:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>How might we create the product which is full of users' preferences?</li>
            <li>How might we increase conversion by selling "courses"?</li>
            <li>How might we help users to understand the value of the product?</li>

          </ul>

          <div class="mb-5"></div>
          <h3 class="text-center">By unpacking the insights, 4 things to enhance were:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Ensure opportunities are at one stop service: </strong> They prefer being served
              varieties of opportunities in one click. Volunteer positions and internships are the most demanded
              backed by quantitative data too. 21% of interviewees specifically mentioned the word "One Stop
              Service" in opportunities.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhance engagement Activities: </strong> Users’ engagement and satisfaction feeling has
              been raised due to the facts of having fun and reflection as well as being reminded through
              knowledgeable context with such as general knowledge fun quizzes, weekly updated journal and
              learning tips and tricks with reminders.</li>
            <li><strong>Unriddle the interface: </strong> The interface has been simplified from 5 categories to
              3 categories where users can access one stop service opportunities, learn to achieve those
              opportunities and have fun and reflection with quizzes.</li>
            <li><strong>Intensive Learning Pathways: </strong>We re-designed 2 months self-paced learning
              journey which is specifically focusing on necessary foundation of digital and soft skills to 4-6
              months self-paced learning journey which can be considered intermediate level instead of providing
              random micro-courses.</li>
          </ol>

          <div class="mb-5"></div>
          <h3 class="text-center">1 insight to address and 2 hypothesises to testify were:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Decrease Website Error: </strong> 40% of dissatisfaction comes from website errors.
              Users couldn't access some contents due to frequent technical problem.</li>
            <li><strong>Do marketing for free courses and skill tests through success story: </strong> The
              conversion can be raised double if we can surely sell the values of free courses and quizzes in
              terms of the above insight. Our team tested the marketing strategy via marketizing to each feature
              and boosting those post with a certain equal amount of money. Then, measured the conversion of
              each post.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhance user’s life time value (LTV) to 3 months through product value understanding:
              </strong> 30 % out of all interviewees paid in 3 months option among 1month, 3 months and 6
              months. Nearly 40% of users are able to start buying 3 months option if we can actually sell the
              values to them.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="mt-5">
          <h3 class="highlight">Enhancing Conversion and Decreasing Churn</h3>
          <p>After addressing the insights from 19 lovers interview, I made ethnographic interview with 10 people. 
             The reason was to craft the churn rate and increase the retention of the product.
             I chose the people in a way that
            <ul>
              <li>3 people who extend the payment from old dis-ordered learning-design</li>
              <li>3 people who extend the payment from new intensive learning-design</li>
              <li>2 people who churned away</li>
              <li>2 people who has the potential to be churned away </li>

          <h3 class="text-center">4 Main Insights were:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Understanding chatbot and knowing features is one of the factors for retention. 83% of retention
              interviewees understand how to use chatbot. </li>

            <li>30% of interviewees have got confidence to attend any other online course for their own skills

          <h3 class="text-center">Where I was stuck by:</h3>
          <h4 class="text-center">“ I am wondering weakening the understanding of product feature means due to weak onboarding conversation ”</h4>

          <div class="mb-5"></div>
          <h3 class="text-center">Reframing the problem:</h3>
          <h4 class="text-center">“ How might we develop conversational onboarding about product’s features and how to use chatbot? ”</h4>
        
          <div class="mb-5"></div>
          <h3 class="text-center">In terms of insights synthesising:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>We could not expect people who come to us for opportunities to use the rest of the
                features such as courses and tests. So as long as one keeps using the “ Opportunities 4 U” tab
                and receiving opportunities, he will stay with us. In other words, as long as they know the
                value of specific features, they will stay with us.
                According to the dashboard lover system, 64% retention people use specific features rather than
                using all features. [I do not show the dashboard due to company’s confidentiality.]
            </li>
            <li>Enhancing MYEO Community so that we can have more users who have been recommended by peers.
            </li>
            <li>Educating about chatbot usage and features as far as we could such as conversation design & more
              accessible for an orientation call. 
            </li>
            <li>From the interviewer's perspective, there are only three types of comers to MYEO.
              <ul>
                <li>Opportunities Hunter ( Opportunities 4 U tab is enough )</li>
                <li>Personal Development Hunter in a way of soft skills & digital skills ( Courses Tab is enough) </li>
                <li>Opportunities & Skills Development Hunter ( Opportunities 4 U & Courses: need to force to use all features ) </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>MYEO needs to craft each comers “who are they” after a specific time and engage them in a personalized way such as sending personalized messages or phoning in order to retain their interest in specific features according to their type.
            Eg : For a personal development hunter, we can display the learning tracks and how he can upgrade himself after this first track.
            Because of the fact that 50% of retention interviewees’s chatbot usage is low but usage on a specific feature is more than any other features.

          <h3 class="highlight">How did we craft churn to 5%</h3>
          <p>Based on those synthesis of insights, the data scientist could run the logistic regression based on 50 data points 
            in order to predict whether a user will buy the product or not 
            while I am analysing the interview’s result in order to set the selling points to each categories. We categorized users into three:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>People who will extend the payment </li>
            <li>People who are likely to extend </li>
            <li>People who will not extend </li>
          </ul>
          <p>I led the sale team in order to make a call to people who are likely to extend together with sale pitch. 
            90% of logistic regression was true and we could decrease churn into 5.2%.
