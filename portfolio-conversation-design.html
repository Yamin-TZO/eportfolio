            <p>
              Our goal is to build an effective and accessible learning system that can enhance 
              youths’ learning experience via bite-sized contents with the minimum effort. 
              There is lack of proficiency and efficiency for conversational writing in a team in order to deliver quality contents to achieve that goal.

          <div class="p-2">
            <h3 class="highlight">The Solution</h3>

              We want to create effective manual and multiple conversation architecture flows 
              which are fitted-into based on learning objectives and outcomes while educating the working team members with intellectually tangible ways.
            </p>
            <p>
              I started it with the first stage of design thinking process “empathize” in order to understand the conversation scope and approach the problems with human-centered 
              and design thinking methods iteratively throughout the process. It includes different methods such as
              <b>
                Enthographic Interview, A/B Testing, Quantitative Analysis, Market Research, Usability Testing and Participatory Designing.

            Based on the process which users are using,

          <p>
            Under Main Conversation Flow, there will be three sorts of flow which is directly

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Topic-focused Teaching - </strong>
                One teaching method based on the specific topic. For example: Google Drive Lecture, Cyber Secuirty Protocol Lectures.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Skills-filtered Teaching - </strong>
                One teaching method based on student’s knowledge level on specific topic. Hence, this type usually includes with quizzes before lectures. 
                For example: Google Drive (Basic), Google Drive (Intermediate), Cyber Security Protocol (Intermediate)
              </li>
              <li><strong>Story-based Teaching - </strong>
                One teaching method based on stories and case studies. 
                For example: How a student can use Google Drive for productivity (real life story based)
              </li> 
            </ul>

          <p>
            Besides the mentoring from my supervisor, he and I came up with the conversational fundamental principles which can be helpful to create better conversational flow. 
            After I have created the conversation flow templates, I double checked with the principles whether the flows meet with them.

            After finishing the conversation architecture flow templates, 
            it is the time to write the manual which can effectively guide users for exactly what they want to find.
          </p>
          <p>
            I read the book called 
            <i>“Developing Quality Technical Information: A Handbook for Writers and Editors” </i> 
            and research about how good manual looks like such as reasearching git manual and other gitlab manual. Form the research and reading, I conclude with three main characteristics how to start the manual.
          </p>
          <h3 class="highlight">Three Main Characteristics</h3>
          <p>
            <ul>

              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>

              Actually, this is not all. I update the conversation architecture flows over times with the iterative usability testing and A/B testing of the flows.
              Based on testing and analysis, the conversation flows have been improved with gradual better learning experience to learners.

              The restructuring of conversation architecture flow with tailor-made templates could enhance the working team’s productivity
